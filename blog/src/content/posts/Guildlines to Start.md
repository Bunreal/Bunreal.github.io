### Blockquotes

> Human beings face ever more complex and urgent problems, and their effectiveness in dealing with these problems is a matter that is critical to the stability and continued progress of society.

\- Doug Engelbart, 1961

### Inline code

Text inside `backticks` on a line will be formatted like code. 


### Code blocks

Syntax highlight is supported with the language specified after the first set of backticks. We use prismjs for syntax highlighting, a list of supported languages can be found [at their site](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages)

```js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
    
    Text indented with a tab is formatted like this, and will also look like a code block in preview.

### Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | ------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

### Footnotes

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: meaningful!

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.

You can also use inline footnotes. ^[notice that the carat goes outside of the brackets on this one.]

### Highlighting

Use two equal signs to ==highlight text==.
